# Asset2SD plugin for Phonegap #
By Gautam Chaudhary

Phonegap plugin for Android for copying files from app assets to device SD Card.
Tested with Phonegap versions 1.3 and 1.4
Needs changes to make it work with Phonegap version >= 2.0

## Adding the Plugin to your project ##

1. To install the plugin, move `asset2sd.js` to your project's www folder and include a reference to it in your html files. 
2. Create a folder `gkcgautam` within your project's `src/com/` folder and move the file `Asset2SD.java` into it.

## Using the plugin ##
The plugin creates the object `window.plugins.Asset2SD` with method `startActivity`. 

The full params are as follows:

* asset_file - The file to be copied from app assets. For example, "www/images/photo.jpg"
* destination_file_location - The folder in SD Card to which the file should be copied. If the folder doesn't already exist, it gets created automatically.
* destination_file - The name with which the file has to saved. For example, "image.jpg"
* callback Success callback.
* fail Error callback

Example usage:

    window.plugins.Asset2SD.startActivity({
		asset_file: "www/images/photo.jpg",
		destination_file_location: "Photos",
		destination_file: "photo.jpg"},
		function() { alert('success'); }, 
		function() { alert('fail'); }
	);
